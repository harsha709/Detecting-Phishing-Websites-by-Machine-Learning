# Detecting-Phishing-Websites-by-Machine-Learning
We developed an machine learning model to detect phishing or malicious websites. We used machine learning classifiers, trained, tested and processed the data. Random Forest classifier gave the highest accuracy for us.
We then developed web application by using Flask Framework and python.
